This Python script allows you to control a DJI Tello drone and perform face tracking using OpenCV. The drone will take off, track your face, and make adjustments to keep the detected face within the frame.

## Prerequisites

To use this script, you need the following:

- DJI Tello drone
- Python 3
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- [DJI Tello Python library](https://github.com/damiafuentes/DJITelloPy)

## Getting Started

1. Install the required libraries if you haven't already. You can use pip to install OpenCV and NumPy:

   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python-headless numpy


2. Check explanation of the code in [Explanation.md](Explaination.md)
3. Check the main loop explanation in [MainLoop.md](MainLoop.md)
